        // ⚙️ XP Filtering Logic Explained
        // The XP System uses a "Safety-First" hierarchy to decide who earns XP.
        // 🚫 The Master Blacklist (Priority 1)
        // Blacklists always take precedence. If a User, Role, or Channel is added to a Blacklist, XP gain is instantly disabled for those targets.
        // - Role Blacklist: Any user with one of these roles is blocked from earning XP.
        // - Channel Blacklist: No XP can be earned within these channels.
        // - User Blacklist: Specific users who are blocked from the system entirely.
        // Note: If a user is on both a Blacklist and a Whitelist, the Blacklist wins and they will receive 0 XP.
        // ✅ The Master Whitelist (Priority 2)
        // Whitelists act as a "Gatekeeper." If a Whitelist is empty, it is ignored and everyone (who isn't blacklisted) can earn XP.
        // - Role Whitelist: If roles are added here, only users with those roles can earn XP.
        //   - Note: If a blacklisted user have a whitelisted role, they won't get any XP.
        // - Channel Whitelist: If channels are added here, XP can only be earned in those specific locations.
        //   - Note: If a blacklisted user writes in a whitelisted channel, they won't get any XP.
        // - User Whitelist: If users are added here, only those specific individuals can participate in the entire XP system.
        // 💡 The Golden Rule: If a Blacklist trigger exists (User, Role, or Channel), it cancels any Whitelist permission.
