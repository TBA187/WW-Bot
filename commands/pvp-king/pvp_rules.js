                    `- Tag an <@&${this.officerRoleID}> after your match to be Crowned.\n` +
                    `- Even if the King defends the throne, post the results! We track **Winning Streaks** 🔥 to honor our greatest champions.\n` +
                    `- The PvP King may decline a challenge with a valid reason. However, should a challenge go ignored for **48 hours**, the King shall be deemed to have **Forfeited**, and the Crown will pass automatically to the first challenger!\n` +
                    `- All PvP Kings are reborn in the eternal frost, claiming the <@&${this.pvpWarriorRoleID}> role as tribute to the **White Walker** legion!\n` +
